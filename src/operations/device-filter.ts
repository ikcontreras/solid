/**
 * SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE (SRP)
 * -------------------------------------
 * The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class or module should have only one reason to change,
 * meaning it should only have one responsibility or handle one specific part of the functionality in a system. In
 * simpler terms, each class or function should focus on doing one thing and doing it well. By adhering to SRP, the
 * code becomes easier to maintain, test, and extend, as changes in one responsibility wonâ€™t affect other parts of the
 * system. It also reduces the complexity and improves the clarity of the code.
